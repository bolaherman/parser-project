## Building AI course project
## Summary

* PROBLEM: When hiring, professionals spend a lot of time going through several individual startups to find the right people for the job. It takes time and does not work. While this can be automated by a series of articles, it has many drawbacks. Candidates who know this process will add many more topics to be listed where others will ask even though they have the required skills.

* SOLUTION: You can use Resume Parser to refine the task of searching through a large number of resumes and finding the right ones for the level. This will help you select voters with the skills required to save time and effort to work effectively. AI and ML can help build an application that scans other factors and selects successful ones.
